#Git Start 

What have you done? 
- I was learning how to use git today. Since I am using MAC pro, I get to use terminal to find the way to use git. It was hard first time but now I feel like I can write this reflection everyday, like diary. 

What is git? 
- Github is a storage that can contain the sources that people code. Also, it works like a libiary that are processing and containing all the processed data (code) from when I commit it. (like when you catch the pokemon and want to save it, you can save that section and move on and came back later on. / It can be worked like a stac files) 

How to use git? 
- Probably I guess it is good to visit different places, like google to search it. 
- Documentation, configuration, feature, and bug fix is important key words to know 

What to do? 
- Maybe next time, I want to know more about how to process sources that I processed from jupyter notebook and in python.
